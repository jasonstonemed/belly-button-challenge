# belly-button-challenge

# BACKGROUND: The Belly Button Challenge originated in 2011 to investigate the microbial fauna in human navels. The goal was to identify microrganisms and influences on microbial living in the belly button.

# The bacterial findings were identified taxonomically by genus-species and classified as OTU's (Operational Taxonomical Units) for the purpose of this study. Sample_value is the microbial count for each organism.

# In this challenge, the goal was to create a dashboard with an interactive feature, in this case, choosing a unique ID number for each test subject.  In response, the dashboard retuns the demographic data in an information box and two graphs, each representative of the individual Subject ID selected. The first is a bar graph demonstrating the top 10 OTU's found and their counts (sample_values). A bubble chart is also produced, representing all microbes found and their counts.
